        <h2><span>The World Series of Poker (WSOP)</span></h2>
        <img class="img-float set-margins" src="images/wsop1970.jpg"  alt="Photo of the 1970 Tournament">
        <p> The World Series of Poker is a series of poker tournaments that are held in Paradise, Nevada.  The idea of a World Series began in 1969 with an event called the Texas Gambling Reunion. This invite-only event was sponsored by Tom Moore, and held at the Holiday Hotel and Casino in Reno. The WSOP originated in 1970, when seven of the best-known poker players participated in a single tournament at the Horseshoe Casino for a single tournament; there was a set start and stop time, and the winner was determined by secret ballot.  The games at this event were a series of cash games, including: five-car stud, razz, and Texas hold'em.
        <br>   
        This evolved over the years, until 2005 where the World Series of Poker Circuit was held annually at a variety of casinos.  The "main event" buy-in is 10,000$. By 2009, the series had grown to 59 events, and by 2022 there were 118 events (78 of which took place).  The Rio hosted the 2006 World Series of Poker, which began on June 25 with satellite events and formally began the day after with the annual Casino Employee event, won in 2006 by Chris Gros. 2006 featured the Tournament of Champions on June 25 and 26, won by Mike Sexton.  Various events led up to the Main Event, which was held from July 28 until August 10. The first prize of $12 million was awarded to Jamie Gold.

        <h2><span>Expansion of the WSOP</span></h2>
        <p>The World Series of Poker Europe (WSOPE) is the first expansion of the World Series of Poker in series history. In September 2007, the first WSOP championship events outside of Las Vegas, complete with bracelets, were held.[20] The inaugural WSOPE consisted of three events held in London from September 6-17, 2007. The main event, a GBP 10,000 buy-in no-limit hold 'em tournament, was won by Norwegian online prodigy Annette Obrestad on the day before her 19th birthday. This made her the youngest person ever to win a WSOP bracelet, a record that cannot be broken in the Las Vegas WSOP under current laws because the minimum legal age for casino gaming in Nevada is 21.

        <p>throughout the 2010's, the WSOP expanded globally.  For nearly two decades, the WSOP has been heavily covered on mainstream media, notably ESPN.  The winner of each event receives a WSOP bracelet and monetary prize based on the number of entrants and the buy-in amounts.  These events are so popular that there are consistently thousands of entrants.</p>
        <hr>
        <h2><span>Tournament Format</span></h2>
        <p>Currently, Texas hold 'em, Omaha hold 'em and Seven-card stud are played. The variant H.O.R.S.E has been played in the past, and made a return in 2006. In most tournaments, the sponsoring casino will take between 6-10% of the buy-in, and distributes the rest. The greater the buy-in, the bigger the prize pool.  The winner of each event receives a WSOP bracelet along with their alloted prize money.  The winner of the Main Event is considered to be the World Champion of Poker.  In the 2005 Main Event, US$52,818,610 in prize money was distributed among 560 players, with US$7.5 million as the first prize. The 2006 Main Event, won by Jamie Gold, is the largest single poker tournament by prize pool or by entrant numbers in history; Gold pocketed US$12 million for his victory. In July 2010, it was announced that the winner of the 2010 Main Event would receive just under US$9 million.</p>
