            <p>
                Learn about the <a href="nlhetournaments.html" target="_blank">history</a> of poker. Poker is a very easy game to learn, but it takes a lifetime to master. The goal of poker in all its many variants is to <strong>make the best five card hand</strong> in order to win your opponents chips. Usually, this means a pair of Kings plus three other cards, or three 7s and two other cards, and so on. How you are allowed to make this five card hand, depends on the kind of poker you are playing, and there are many kinds. Learn more about the most popular variant of poker, No Limit Texas Hold'em, <a href="nlherules.html" target="_blank">here</a>.

                    <br>
                    <span id="three">The joke is <bold>there is no three pair in poker</bold> because that would mean using 6 cards, when you are only allowed to use 5 to make the best hand - you can only choose 5 cards to make the best hand, so the most pairs you could ever would be two plus a fifth card!</span>

                <strong>The last and perhaps most important thing to know about poker is that it allows players to bluff.</strong> Bluffing is when you don't have a strong hand, yet you play like you do have one, trying to make the other players surrender their cards. But be careful, other players may call your bluff, expecially if you have nervous body language!

            <h2>Is Poker simply gambling? Is it a sport?</h2>
            <p>It is important to remember that most games at casinos require you to compete against the house. Ever heard the phrase "the house always wins"? <strong>That refers to the fact that you cannot gain an edge over the casino in terms of the money you can expect to make over time.</strong> Sure you can get lucky, but over a long enough term it is mathematically certain the you will lose money! Even on a roulette wheel, where it seems like you can guess black or white for 50/50 odds, the casino will still win 51% of the time while you only win 49% of the time. This is because casinos subtly place a single green colored space on the wheel.

            <p>It also depends on how you play. <em>Simply guessing and making wild moves with your chips is akin to gambling.</em> But that's not the way professionals approach the game. Many are familiar with the aptitude computer have shown in playing a game like chess. But what about a game like poker, which involves so much uncertainty and requires you to act with incomplete information? As it turns out, computers have shown that there are mathematically better and worse ways to play poker. This is where the sport aspect of the game comes in. Poker nowadays is a competition to see who can most closely execute a computer derived strategy. Players around the world now spend years mastering the game in order to take on tough opponents doing the same.
