            <h2>Is Poker simply gambling? Is it a sport?</h2>
            <p>It is important to remember that most games at casinos require you to compete against the house. Ever heard the phrase "the house always wins"? <strong>That refers to the fact that you cannot gain an edge over the casino in terms of the money you can expect to make over time.</strong> Sure you can get lucky, but over a long enough term it is mathematically certain you you will lose money! Even in a roulette wheel, where it seems you can guess black or white for 50/50 odds, the casino will win 51% of the time while you only win 49% of the time. This is because casinos subtly place a single green colored space on the wheel.

            <p>It also depends on how you play. <em>Simply guessing and making wild moves with your money is akin to gambling.</em> But that's not the way professionals approach the game. Many are familiar with the aptitude computer have shown in playing a game like chess. But what about a game like poker, which involves so much uncertainty and requires you to act with incomplete information? As it turns out, computers have shown that there are mathematically better and worse ways to play poker. This is where the sport aspect of the game comes in. Poker nowadays is a competition to see who can most closely execute a computer derived strategy. Players around the world now spend years mastering the game in order to take on tough opponents doing the same.
