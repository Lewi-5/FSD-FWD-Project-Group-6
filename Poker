    <h1> Basic Rules of Poker 
      
    </h1>
    
    <p1>Poker is a card game that involves betting and individual play, where the winner is determined by the ranks and combinations of their cards.</p1>

    <h2>Gameplay</h2> 

     <p>Players take turns dealing the cards and placing bets. Each player is dealt a hand of cards, which they keep hidden from the other players. There are several rounds of betting, with players either folding, calling, or raising their bets. The final round is called the showdown, where the remaining players reveal their cards and the highest hand wins. Players with hands of equal rank split the pot. <br> <br><img src="Poker-Betting-actions.jpg" id="action"><br/></p>
